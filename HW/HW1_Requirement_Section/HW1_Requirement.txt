Project Overview

SnickerSync is a tool designed to improve the merging process in GiggleGit by making it more interactive and user-friendly. The goal is to release an early version for testers and gather feedback for future improvements.

1. Goal and Non-Goal

Goal:

Ensure SnickerSync provides a smooth and engaging merging experience that integrates well with GiggleGit.

Non-Goal:

Developing AI-driven merge conflict resolution is not within the scope of this project.

2. Non-Functional Requirements and Corresponding Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirement 1: Access Control

Only authorized users should have permission to modify SnickerSync settings, while general users should only have access to predefined configurations.

Functional Requirements:

1. User Role Management: Implement an authentication system where only administrators can modify SnickerSync settings, while regular users can only view them.
2. Permission Restrictions: Restrict access to configuration settings, ensuring general users cannot edit or override predefined merge preferences.

Non-Functional Requirement 2: Data Integrity

User activity logs and test group assignments must be stored securely and remain unchanged throughout the testing phase.

Functional Requirements:
1. Data Encryption: Ensure user logs and test assignments are encrypted in the database to prevent tampering.
2. Audit Trail: Implement a read-only logging system where all activity logs are stored securely and cannot be altered by users.
